    <p>My name is Obieze Udemadu, and I am a Junior Computer Science Student at North Carolina A&T State University. I decided to major in Computer Science because of my interest in gaming and technology from a young age. A few hobbies of mine are boxing, reading, and watching or playing basketball. I am excited to learn more about web development through this course.</p>
